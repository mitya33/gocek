# Gocek

[Full documentation here](https://mitya.uk/projects/gocek)

Gocek is a lightweight scrolling state library that allows elements to be acted on when they become (or stop being) visible, such as applying CSS animations or loading as-yet-unloaded images.

Gocek looks for hooks in the DOM, in the form of data attributes, to know which elements to listen to as they become/stop being visible.
